For my hackathon project, I created a [Flutter](flutter.dev) app to help detect allergens in products. It uses Firebase ML's barcode scanning, OCR, and image processing to do this. Read on or watch my [submission video](example.com) for more info!

## Usage / Viewing Instructions

 Unfortunatley, repl doesn't support flutter, but feel free to read the code. Follow the link to the codepen to see it in action. To see the decompiled APK, which is in Java, go to the 'Java' folder. The Dart code is in 'lib/.'
