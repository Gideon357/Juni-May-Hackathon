For my entry to the Juni May 2020 hackathon, I created a [Flutter](flutter.dev) app to help detect allergens in products. It uses Firebase ML's barcode scanning, OCR, and image processing to do this. Read on or watch my [submission video](example.com) for more info!

## About Me

My name is Gideon Grinberg, and I have been coding for ~9 Months. I don't personally have allergies, but a lot of my friends do. My first programming language was Python üêç, and currently I'm coding out the TF models for this project in Python. I used Flutter, which I learned during quarentine.

## Why I made this

I made this because I have friends who have allergies, and whenever they purchase food, it is challenging for them to determine what allergens are in thoose products. This is so for many people, and over 40% of children with allergies have multiple allergies, so this is a propblem. I also saw a number of python ML tutorials around this topic online. I choose to do this in Flutter because I just learned it and wanted to practice this new skill. Last year, there where over 200,000 food allergy related hospitializations and medical procedures to treat anaphylaxis caused by allergies have gone up over 370% since 200y, so I feel that this project will help people world wide. 

## How I made this

I made this using Flutter, which is Google's cross platform UI framework built on Dart, a lightweight, client focused language created at Google, and maintained by Google and the Ecma, a programming standartization organsation. The computer vision is built on Firebase on Firebase MLKit, and runs in the cloud. Currently, I am working to move my ML vision from Firebase to Python with Tensorflow to use a custom model that can work on non-packgaged foods, however the different ingredients used by different people, along with the lack of data and the time constraint posed a challange.
